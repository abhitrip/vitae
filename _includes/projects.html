            Set up a system that answered on open ended questions about images.
Trained a VGG net combined in Keras with 2 layer LSTM on the
MS-Coco dataset. Obtained an accuracy of 59.1%, compared to state of the
art 62%

            Implemented Face Recognition on faces from Yale Database. Did a
comparative study using Nearest Neighbour,kNN, PCA and Fisherâ€™s LDA
methods. Improved accuracy from 45% to 69% on poorly lit faces using LDA.
